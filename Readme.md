# **Python/Flask PDF Merger & Splitter**

### **Introduction**
This web application is for Merging and Splitting PDF's. 

### **How to Use** 
To merge a PDF You must:
1. Type the name of the document you wish to create into the text-box.  
2. Rename all your files you wish to merge using the following format:
		"1-filename.pdf"
		"2-filename.pdf"
		"3-filename.pdf"
3. Upload all the files using the built in upload function.
4. The File will be merged and you will be asked where to save it.

### **The Development** 
This web application was developed using the following technologies: 
* HTML 5 & CSS 3
* Bootstrap 4
* Python 3
* Flask / Jinja
* [PyPDF Module]([https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)) (Developed By: *Phaseit, Inc. and Mathieu Fenniak*)

### **Future Updates**
I plan on adding the Splitting feature and hosting this project online.
